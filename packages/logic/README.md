# Cosmicdapp logic

This package provides three kinds of resources that will make it easier to develop CosmJS based dApps: config, utils, and service.

## Config

The AppConfig definitions that configure the app to work for a given chain.

## Utils

The type definitions and utility functions for working with errors and currencies.

## Service

This resource offers several React context providers, some utility functions, and a `ProtectedSwitch` React component.
