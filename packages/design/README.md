# Cosmicdapp design

This package provides two kinds of resources: theme and components.

## Theme

The theme directory provides global styles for visual consistency across the dApps. It includes a CSS reset, an override for some Ant Design classes, and CSS Custom Properties for spacing, colors, and fonts.

## Components

### Layout primitives

This resource offers some primitives based on the [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev) book.

### Components with logic

There are also some React components available that offer some kind of logic, like logging in or showing the user address.
